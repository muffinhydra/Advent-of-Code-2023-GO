# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository!

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place in December. It's a series of small programming puzzles or challenges released daily. These puzzles are designed for fun, allowing participants to learn new programming concepts or languages while solving problems related to algorithms, data structures, and more.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions and code for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. All the projects and solutions are implemented in Go programming language.

## Advent of Code Website

To learn more about Advent of Code or participate in the event, visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Structure

Each day's challenge is organized in its respective directory (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.). Inside each directory, you'll find the Go source files and any related resources for that day's problem.

## Running the Code

To run the solutions, make sure you have Go installed. Navigate to the specific day's directory and execute the Go file using the command line or your preferred Go development environment.

```bash
go run .

```
